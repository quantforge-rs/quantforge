//! Binance Spot REST adapter. The work is split across sibling modules —
//! [`client`] owns the HTTP transport, [`venue`] implements the
//! `MarketDataSource` and `TradingVenue` ports on top of it, [`signing`]
//! computes the HMAC-SHA256 query signature, [`credentials`] resolves the API
//! keys, and [`types`] and [`convert`] hold the wire DTOs and their mapping
//! onto domain types.
