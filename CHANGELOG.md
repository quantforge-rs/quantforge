# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- codeql static analysis workflow running on pull requests targeting `main`, pushes to `main`, and a weekly schedule
- gitleaks secret scanning workflow covering the full git history on the same triggers plus manual dispatch
- ci, codeql, and gitleaks status badges in `README.md`

### Changed

- the `sdk` module is split into `sdk::strategy` (the `Strategy` trait with its context and error types), `sdk::indicators`, and `sdk::builtin`; crate-root re-exports such as `quantforge::Strategy` and `quantforge::SmaCrossStrategy` are unchanged, but the path import `quantforge::sdk::strategies::SmaCrossStrategy` becomes `quantforge::sdk::builtin::SmaCrossStrategy`
- gitleaks scanning runs the MIT-licensed gitleaks cli directly instead of `gitleaks-action`, which refuses to run for organization-owned repositories without a license key, and uploads its findings to the Security tab as sarif
- the `repository` and `homepage` links point at `quantforge-rs/quantforge` after the repository moved out of a personal account
- the `backtest`, `data_sync`, and `live` modules moved under `engine`; crate-root re-exports such as `quantforge::LiveTradeEngine` are unchanged, but path imports like `quantforge::live::LiveTradeConfig` become `quantforge::engine::live::LiveTradeConfig`
- `Strategy::on_bar` returns the desired target position as plain data instead of mutating a context callback, making the strategy boundary drivable across an FFI boundary
- `StrategyContext` is now a plain-data snapshot struct with owned `market`, `now_ms`, `cash`, and `position_qty` fields instead of a trait
- `Strategy::name` returns `&str` instead of `&'static str` so foreign strategies can report dynamically owned names
- ci runs on pull requests targeting `main` instead of on every push and pull request, removing duplicate workflow runs
- superseded ci runs for the same pull request are cancelled automatically
- `data validate` exits non-zero when validation issues are found
- the CLI rejects non-positive `--cash` and `--quote-order-qty`, negative `--fee-bps`, and `--poll-secs 0` before touching the database or network
- exchange order responses no longer coerce missing fill data to zero: unreported executed quantity, quote quantity, and fills are `None` on `ExchangeOrder`, and the trading engine refuses to update position state from an order without a reported executed quantity
- closed trades are never recorded with fabricated prices: `trade close` and the live exit update position state, then fail with a clear error instead of writing a trade row when entry or exit fill data is missing
- dry-run applies the same pre-trade checks as live (min-notional on entries); live sells are validated against the exchange minimum (dust is skipped with a warning) and maximum quantity rules
- resuming a run by `--run-id` now verifies market, strategy name and parameters, and execution mode and refuses mismatches; `BotRunState` records its execution mode, and `trade close` refuses runs recorded in dry-run mode
- an executed order is always reflected in position state even when journaling the order event fails; the journaling failure is surfaced afterwards with reconciliation guidance
- an unsellable dust remnant left after an exit or manual close is written off with a warning instead of wedging the run in a permanently open position
- opening a database with a mismatched schema version fails with actionable guidance instead of proceeding silently
- the SQLite schema version is now 3 (`BotRunState` gained a required `execution_mode` field); until 1.0.0 schema changes are not backward compatible and there are no migrations — delete the database and re-sync
- data sync summaries report the first synced candle, and bounded syncs warn when the exchange returned no candles for part of the requested window
- startup logs the effective Binance base URL and warns when the database file did not exist and was created empty
- `ms_to_rfc3339` renders out-of-range timestamps as an explicit `invalid-ms(...)` marker instead of a plausible epoch date
- backtests reject non-positive initial cash and negative fees at the engine level; the live bootstrap window uses checked arithmetic
- `trade run --mode live` requires explicit confirmation: an interactive `yes` prompt on a terminal, or `--yes` for unattended runs; non-interactive runs without `--yes` print a preview of the would-be live run and exit without trading
- live-mode confirmations and logs mark production Binance endpoints with `(PRODUCTION)` and a confirmed live run against one logs a warning, replacing the previous default-URL-only startup warning; printed base URLs have userinfo removed
- `data validate` flags non-positive `open`/`high`/`low`/`close` prices and negative volume; zero volume remains valid
- candle gap detection no longer overflows on open times near the representable maximum; an unrepresentable expected open time is reported as a gap

### Removed

- `BacktestConfig` no longer implements `Default`; construct its fields explicitly instead of relying on fabricated cash and fee values

### Fixed

- `Interval::H8` now formats as `8h` instead of `1m`
- re-sync any 8h candles written before this fix; they were stored under the `1m` interval key
- `Symbol` deserialization now validates and normalizes (trim, uppercase, reject empty) exactly like `Symbol::new`, closing the bypass on `state_json`/`raw_json` reloads
- zero-valued exchange filter limits (Binance renders "no constraint" as `0.00000000`, as its testnet does for `MARKET_LOT_SIZE`) are treated as absent rules, so quantity rounding falls back to `LOT_SIZE` instead of receiving a zero step

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-21

### Changed

- kept the repository as a single Cargo package with internal modules
- replaced the `download` command with the `data` command group
- expanded SQLite from candle storage into candle plus bot journal storage

### Added

- incremental and follow-mode candle synchronization
- live-trading runtime with dry-run and live execution modes
- manual trade close command
- monitor command group for balances, open orders, recent trades, cancel, and manual close
- signed Binance Spot client support for account and order endpoints

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- single-package QuantForge CLI project layout
- Binance Spot OHLCV ingestion
- SQLite candle storage
- candle validation tooling
- deterministic event-driven backtest engine
- strategy SDK with SMA crossover example
- CI, packaging checks, and contributor documentation
